# Grok-powered Discord Bot

This project implements a Discord bot powered by the Grok AI model. The bot is designed to engage in conversations, analyze images, and provide roast-style responses when requested.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application
- `bot.py`: Contains the main Discord bot implementation
- `command_handlers.py`: Handles different types of commands and conversations
- `config.py`: Sets up logging for the application
- `grok_client.py`: Implements the GrokClient for interacting with the Grok AI API
- `message_history.py`: Manages conversation history
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for image processing and message handling

## How It Works

1. **Initialization (`main.py`):**
   - Sets up the Discord client
   - Connects to the Discord API

2. **Discord Bot Event Handling (`bot.py`):**
   - `on_ready()`: Called when the bot successfully connects to Discord
   - `on_message()`: Triggered whenever a message is sent in a channel the bot has access to

3. **Command Handling (`command_handlers.py`):**
   - `handle_regular_conversation()`: Manages normal conversation flow
   - `handle_roast_command()`: Handles specific roast commands

4. **Grok AI Integration (`grok_client.py`):**
   - `GrokClient` class:
     - `get_response()`: Sends messages to the Grok API and receives responses
     - `analyze_image()`: Sends image URLs to Grok for analysis

5. **Conversation History Management (`message_history.py`):**
   - Keeps track of recent messages in the conversation
   - Helps maintain context for AI responses

6. **Utility Functions (`utils.py`):**
   - Converting WebP images to PNG format
   - Extracting image URLs from messages
   - Sending long responses in chunks to comply with Discord's message length limits

## Key Features

- Natural language conversation using the Grok AI model
- Image analysis capabilities
- Roast command for humorous interactions
- Conversation history management for contextual responses
- Handling of long responses by splitting them into multiple messages

## Setup and Deployment

The project includes configuration files for easy setup and deployment:

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies
- `environment.yml`: Defines the Conda environment (if using Conda for package management)
- `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions for building a Docker image of the bot
- `deploy.yml`: Likely contains deployment configuration (e.g., for CI/CD pipelines)

To run the bot:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or set up the Conda environment:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. Set up the necessary environment variables:
   - Discord bot token
   - Grok API key

3. Run the bot:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

Alternatively, you can build and run the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys or tokens to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions for sensitive information
- Regularly review and update dependencies for security patches

## File Relationships and Function Calls

1. `main.py`:
   - Imports and initializes the Discord client from `bot.py`
   - Starts the bot

2. `bot.py`:
   - Imports `command_handlers` for processing messages
   - `on_message()` function calls appropriate handlers from `command_handlers.py`

3. `command_handlers.py`:
   - Imports `GrokClient` from `grok_client.py` for AI interactions
   - Imports `MessageHistory` from `message_history.py` for conversation tracking
   - Imports utility functions from `utils.py`
   - `handle_regular_conversation()`: Calls `GrokClient.get_response()` and `MessageHistory` methods
   - `handle_roast_command()`: Calls `GrokClient.get_response()` with specific instructions

4. `grok_client.py`:
   - Implements the `GrokClient` class for Grok API communication
   - May use utility functions from `utils.py` for image processing

5. `message_history.py`:
   - Implements the `MessageHistory` class for managing conversation context

6. `utils.py`:
   - Provides standalone utility functions used by other modules

7. `config.py`:
   - Sets up logging configuration used across the application
